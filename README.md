1. Histogram of PassengerId:
The distribution of PassengerId is uniform, as expected, since it is simply a unique identifier assigned to each passenger. It does not carry analytical meaning and shows no pattern or trend.
2. Bar Chart of Survived:
The bar chart shows that a larger number of passengers did not survive compared to those who did. This indicates a class imbalance in the dataset. Specifically, based on previous stats:
About 63.64% of passengers did not survive
Only 36.36% of passengers survived
This is a key observation for any classification model or survival analysis.
